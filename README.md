# Nathans First Project



## Getting started with Django
Here's a helpful link to get started with Django!
I completed this to help me learn.
[Here's a good starting place.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/)

Here's exactly the tutorial sections you need. Don't bother doing the entire thing, there's a lot of fluff you won't need. (Especially with just a week to prepare.) I copied and pasted this from the django.md file.
### Tutorial sections which I expect you to understand

-   [Part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/)
-   [Part 2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial02/)
-   [Part 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial03/)
-   [Part 4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial04/) except for the last portion "Use generic views: Less code is better"
-   [Part 6](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial06/)


### Portions that you may safely skip over

-   [Part 4 section "Use generic views: Less code is better"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial04/)
-   [Part 5 "Introducing automated testing"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial05/)
-   [Part 7 "Customize the admin form"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial07/)

## When you're ready, here's the code to snag the repo.
```bash


$ git clone git@gitlab.com:shadownate12/nathans-first-project.git
```
